* Client/Server architecture divides the work of computing between “clients” and “servers.”
  * Clients make requests of servers and process the results of those requests.
    For example, a client application might request data from a database server. Another client application might send a request to an environmental control server to lower the temperature in a room.
    
  * Servers respond to requests by returning data or other information to clients, or by taking some action.
    For example, a database server returns tabular data and information about that data to clients, and an electronic mail server directs incoming mail toward its final destination.
