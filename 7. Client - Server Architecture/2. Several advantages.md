Client/server architecture has several advantages over traditional program architectures:

* Application size and complexity can be significantly reduced because common services are handled in a single location, a server. This simplifies client applications, reduces duplicate code, and makes application maintenance easier.

* Client/server architecture facilitates communication between varied applications. Client applications that use dissimilar communications protocols cannot communicate directly, but can communicate through a server that “speaks” both protocols.

* Client/server architecture allows applications to be developed with distinct components, which can be modified or replaced without affecting other parts of the application.
