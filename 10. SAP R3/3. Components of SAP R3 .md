   *ABAP+Java System Architecture*
  
1. **Message Server:** It handles communication between distributed Dispatchers in ABAP system.
2. **Dispatcher Queue:** Various work process types are stored in this queue.
3. **Dispatcher:** It distributes requests to the work processes.
4. **Gateway:** It enables communication between SAP system and between SAP system and external systems.
5. **ABAP-Work processes:** – It separately executes dialog steps in R/3 applications.
  
  Types of work processes are given as below:-

6. **Memory-pipes:** It enables communication between ICM and ABAP work processes.
7. **Message Server:** It handles java dispatchers and server processes.It enables communication within java runtime environment.
8. **Enqueue Server:** It handles logical locks that are set by the executed Java application program in a server process.
9. **Central Services:** Java cluster requires a special instance of the central services for managing locks and transmitting messages and data. Java cluster is a set of processes that work together to build the reliable system. Instance is group of resources such as memory, work processes and so on.
10. **Java Dispatcher:** It receives the client requests and forwards to the server process.
11. **SDM:** Software Deployment Manager is used to install J2EE components.
12. **Java Server Processes:** It can processes a large number of requests simultaneously.
13. **Threading:** Multiple Processes executes separately in the background, this concept is called threading.
14. **ICM:** It enables communication between SAP system and HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP protocol. It means by entering system URL in the browser you can access SAP from browser also.

One more component is JCO. JCO is used to handle communication between java dispatcher and ABAP dispatcher when system is configured as ABAP+Java.
